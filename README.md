## 🧠 Project Overview
The **Daily Calorie Tracker CLI** is a simple Python console-based tool that allows users to:
- Log their daily meals  
- Enter calorie values for each meal  
- Calculate **total** and **average** calorie intake  
- Compare against a personal daily calorie **limit**  
- Get an instant **warning** if they exceed their limit  
- (Bonus) Save the session details to a text file for record keeping  

This mini-project demonstrates **basic Python programming** using only **Unit 1 and Unit 2** concepts.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I practiced:
- Using `input()` for user interaction  
- Working with variables, data types, and type conversion  
- Using arithmetic and comparison operators  
- Writing conditional statements (`if...else`)  
- Iterating with `for` loops  
- Managing data using **lists**  
- Formatting outputs using **f-strings**, `\t`, and `\n`  
- Performing file I/O using `open()`, `write()`, and `close()`
